![weather-app-showcase1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/078b5a4b-160d-4784-be1c-d72f2c2ddaf8)  

## 🎯 Overview  
This **Weather App** was my first Python project, following a tutorial by **Bro Code** on YouTube. It fetches and displays real-time weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API** and presents it in a simple **PyQt5 GUI**.  

This project helped me get comfortable with:  
- **Python fundamentals** (variables, functions, libraries).  
- **API integration** (fetching and handling JSON data).  
- **GUI development** with **PyQt5**.

## ✨ What It Does  
- 🌍 **City Search** – Fetch weather details by entering a city name.  
- 🌡 **Temperature Display** – Shows temperature in **Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin**.  
- ☁ **Weather Type** – Displays conditions like **sunny, cloudy, or rainy**.  
- 🔄 **Dynamic Weather Icons** – Uses symbols for different weather states.  
- 🚨 **Error Handling** – Provides feedback for invalid inputs, API issues, and network errors.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Learned  
- **Python 3** – First real-world experience writing Python code.  
- **PyQt5** – Built a graphical user interface for user interaction.  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – Integrated real-time weather data using API requests.  
- **Requests Library** – Sent HTTP requests and processed JSON responses.  
- **Basic Debugging & Error Handling** – Managed API failures and invalid inputs gracefully.

## 🔄 Looking Back  
This project was a great introduction to **Python scripting** and **API-based applications**. If I were to improve it today, I’d:  
- **Refactor the code** to be more modular and efficient.  
- **Enhance the UI** with better styling and animations.  
- **Add multi-day forecasts** for more detailed weather predictions.
